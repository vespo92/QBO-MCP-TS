Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, provide:

- **Clear title and description**
- **Use case and motivation**
- **Possible implementation approach**
- **Alternative solutions considered**
- **Breaking changes** if any

### Your First Code Contribution

Look for issues labeled:
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention needed
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure all tests pass**: `npm test`
2. **Run code quality checks**: `npm run check:all`
3. **Update documentation** if needed
4. **Add tests** for new functionality
5. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes
6. **Ensure PR description** clearly describes the problem and solution

### PR Title Format

Use conventional commits format:
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions or changes
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks
- `perf:` Performance improvements

Example: `feat: add batch invoice processing support`

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use **strict type checking**
- Avoid `any` types - use `unknown` or specific types
- Prefer **interfaces over type aliases** for objects
- Use **const assertions** where appropriate
- Document complex types with JSDoc comments

### Code Style

- Follow ESLint configuration (run `npm run lint`)
- Use Prettier for formatting (run `npm run format`)
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### File Organization

```

â”œâ”€â”€ api/        # QuickBooks API client
â”œâ”€â”€ services/   # Business logic services
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/      # MCP tool definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ resources/  # MCP resource definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ transports/ # Transport implementations

â”œâ”€â”€ utils/      # Utility functions
â””â”€â”€ index.ts    # Entry point
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Place tests next to the code they test (`*.test.ts`)
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for **80%+ code coverage**
- Focus on critical business logic
- Don't test trivial getters/setters
- Test error handling paths

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add **JSDoc comments** for public APIs
- Include **parameter descriptions**
- Document **return values** and exceptions
- Provide **usage examples** for complex functions

### README Updates

Update README.md when:
- Adding new features
- Changing configuration
- Modifying installation steps
- Adding new dependencies

### API Documentation

- Document all MCP tools and resources
- Include request/response examples
- Describe error conditions
- Update `examples/` directory

## Review Process

### What We Look For

- **Code quality** and adherence to standards
- **Test coverage** and quality
- **Documentation** completeness
- **Performance** considerations
- **Security** best practices
- **Backward compatibility**

### Review Timeline

- Initial review within **3-5 business days**
- Follow-up reviews within **2-3 business days**
