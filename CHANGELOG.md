## Migration Guide from QBOMCP (Python) to QBOMCP-TS

### For Claude Desktop Users

1. **Update your configuration**:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "quickbooks": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/path/to/QBOMCP-TS/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "QBO_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
           "QBO_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret",
           "QBO_COMPANY_ID": "your_company_id",
           "QBO_REFRESH_TOKEN": "your_refresh_token"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Build the TypeScript version**:
   ```bash
   cd QBOMCP-TS
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. **All existing tools remain compatible** - The API interface is unchanged

### For Production Users

1. **New SSE transport available**:
   ```bash
   npm run start:sse
   ```

2. **Enhanced monitoring**:
   - Health check: `http://localhost:3000/health`
   - API status: Use the `get_api_status` tool

3. **Improved error handling**:
   - More descriptive error messages
   - Automatic retry for transient failures
   - Better suggestions for fixing issues

### Breaking Changes
- None - Full backward compatibility maintained

### Deprecations
- Python version will be maintained for 6 months but not receive new features
